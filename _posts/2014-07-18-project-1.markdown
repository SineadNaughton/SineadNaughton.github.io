description: VESTIMONY is a social-commerce fashion Android application. It allows users to post fashion inspiration and review clothing that is available to buy online. I developed the application from concept initialization to the finished application. It is a distributed system. The backend is a RESTful API built using the Spring Boot framework, and a MySQL database. The front end is a web client built in Angular, and an android mobile application built in Android Studio that renders the web client in a web view.
